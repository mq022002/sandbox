1. Can I optimize my solution or solve it using a different approach?

- Sorting
- Hash set

2. Did I use the most appropriate data structure?

- No, I could've used a hash set to keep track of numbers and adding them to the set as I iterate over the entire array, meaning I wouldn't have to go over it twice.

3. Are there edge cases I missed?

- I didn't have them explicitly mentioned in my test cases, but it doesn't crash on empty arrays, or other data types.

4. What did I struggle with, or learn from this problem?

- Figuring out a solution beyond a nested for-loop.
